<h1> DIYARBAKIR </h1>
<p>   The earliest reference to the city comes from Assyrian records which identify it as being the capital of the Aramean kingdom of Bit-Zamani (ca. 1300 BC). In the ninth century BC, the city joined a rebellion against the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III. The city was later reduced to being a province of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

From 189 BCE to 384 CE, the region to the east and south of present Diyarbakır came under the rule of the Hellenistic kingdom of Corduene.

Later, the Romans colonized the city and named it Amida, after the earlier name Amid. During the Roman rule, the first city walls were constructed in 297. Later, the greater walls were built as per the command of the Roman emperor Constantius II. After the Romans, the Persians came to power and were succeeded by the Muslim Arabs. It was the leader of the Arab Bekr tribe, Bekr Bin Vail, who named the city Diyar Bakr, meaning "the country of Bakr", i.e. Arabs.

After a few centuries, Diyarbakır came under the Ottoman Empire and earned the status of 
the capital of a large province. The city became the base of army troops who guarded the 
region against Persian invasion. Diyarbakır faced turbulence in the 20th century, particularly 
with the onset of World War I. The majority of the city's Syriac and Armenian population were 
massacred and deported during the Armenian Genocide in 1915. In 1925, armed Kurdish groups 
rose in the Sheikh Said rebellion against the newly established secular government of the 
Republic of Turkey with the aim to revive the Islamic caliphate and sultanate, but were 
defeated by Turkish forces.
